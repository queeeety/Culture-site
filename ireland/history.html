        <h2>Arrival Of Christianity</h2>
        <p>
          The history of modern Ireland started all the way back in the 5th
          century with the arrival of Christianity. St. Patrick arrived as a
          missionary to Ireland and proceeded to devote his life to converting
          the mainly Pagan people to Christianity. This had a huge impact and by
          the end of the 5th century a great many Irish people had converted to
          Christianity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of this influx of Christianity, monasteries would be built
          which would serve as centers of learning, art, and culture. Some of
          these monasteries can even still be seen today, such as Clonmacnoise
          (pictured below).
        </p>

          class="img-fluid"
        />
        <p>
          These monasteries and the learning that they provided thrust Ireland
          into what some call the "Golden Age" of Irish culture in the 6th and
          7th centuries. The monasteries attracted students from all over
          Europe, allowing for the exchange of ideas and knowledge with people
          from many different places. The monks themselves are also a huge part
          of the culture at the time, as they are very well known for creating
          beautiful works of art and manuscripts with extremely intricate
          details.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of these manuscripts that is extremely influential is The Book of
          Kells. It represents the merging of Christian religious themes with
          Ireland’s rich tradition of decorative arts. Irish monasteries became
          centers of not just learning but also craftsmanship, particularly in
          metalwork, illuminated manuscripts, and other artistic traditions.

        <h2>Viking Settlement</h2>
        <p>
          The vikings also played an important role in the history of Ireland.
          They began to raid the island in the 8th century, sacking monasteries
          in search of their wealth. Eventually though, while they continued to
          ransack parts of the island, they began to settle down in others. The
          bases for the majority of big cities in Ireland today, such as Dublin,
          Cork, Waterford, Wexford and Limerick, can be traced back to old
          Viking settlements

        <h2>British Occupation</h2>
        <p>
          In the 16th century King Henry VIII of England began to want to expand
          England's control over Ireland, which at the time was still made up of
          scattered kingdoms controlled by the Gaelic lords. The Tudor
          government began to confiscate land from the Gaelic lords and planting
          loyal English settlers there. The Gaelic lords did not appreciate this
          and attempted to fight back against the English, but any attempts at
          this were brutally surpressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They introduced the Penal Laws, which were hards anti-Catholic laws
          that were introduced to marginalise the Catholic's and increase
          Protestant power. Catholics were barred from owning land, voting,
          holding public office, and practicing their religion freely.

            Due to exploitive farming practices enforced by the British
            government, the land in Ireland was over-farmed. This in combination
            with severe weather caused the potato crops, which were the main
            food source for the Irish people, to develop blight and become
            inedible. Hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of this,
            and almost 2 million more left the country to seek a life elsewhere.

        <h2>Independence at Last</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the early 20th century, the Irish people began to campaign
          for self governance within the UK, in a movement known as Home Rule,
          but were resisted by the Protestant majority in the Ulster.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension eventually boiled over and a rebellion broke out, known as
          the 1916 Rising. While the rebellion itself was unsuccessful, it
          emboldened the Irish people and the demand for Independence was larger
          than ever.
        </p>

        <p>
          This prompted a war to break out known as the "War of Independence" in
          which the Irish Republican Army (IRA) waged war against the British
          forces using guerrilla warfare tactics. This war was successful and
          resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which declared 26 counties to be
          part of the "Irish Free State", an independent country, and the 6
          remaining counties to be "Northern Ireland" which remained a member of
          the UK
