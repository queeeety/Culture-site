        <h2>Oisín i dTír na nÓg</h2>
        <p>
          Oisín was a member of na Fianna, who were a warrior-hunter band in
          ancient Ireland. One day as they were out hunting, a radiant figure
          appeared riding towards them on a white horse. Her name was Niamh
          Chinn Óir. She had come to tell Oisín of a land known as Tír na nÓg
          (the Land of Youth), a place where people never grew old or died. She
          also told Oisín that she had fallen in love with him and wanted him to
          come back to Tír na nÓg with her. Oisín was entranced by her beauty
          and agreed. He climbed onto the white horse with her and it carried
          them back across the sea to Tír na nÓg.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Tír na nÓg, Oisín and Niamh lived in happiness and luxury. The land
          was a paradise where no one aged, the trees were always in bloom, and
          music and laughter filled the air. Oisín became beloved in this
          magical realm, and time seemed to pass in an unbroken stream of joy.
          After some time, Oisín began to feel the pull of home. He longed to
          see his father, Fionn, and his companions in the Fianna once more.
          Niamh was against this and did not want him to return, but Oisín was
          adamant. Eventually she reluctantly allowed him to return. She gave
          him the white horse and made him promise one thing: he must never
          dismount or touch the ground in Ireland, or the spell of Tír na nÓg
          would break, and he would age all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Oisín arrived back in Ireland, he found the land much changed.
          The Fianna were long gone, their stories now legend. The people he
          encountered spoke of Fionn mac Cumhaill as a figure from the distant
          past. Heartbroken, Oisín realized that hundreds of years had passed
          while he was in Tír na nÓg. As he rode through the countryside, he
          came across a group of men struggling to move a heavy boulder. Ever
          the heroic warrior, Oisín leaned down from his horse to help them. In
          doing so, he lost his balance and fell to the ground. The moment he
          touched the earth, the magic of Tír na nÓg vanished. Oisín aged
          instantly, becoming a withered old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oisín was later found by Saint Patrick, who listened to his story of
          Tír na nÓg and the Fianna. Through Oisín’s tales, Patrick learned
          about the old pagan world of Ireland and its heroes. However, Oisín,
          filled with grief and longing for his lost companions and the love of
          Niamh, remained deeply sorrowful.

        <h2>The Children of Lir</h2>
        <p>
          Lir, a nobleman of the Tuatha Dé Danann (a race similar to gods in
          Irish mythology), was married to a kind and beautiful woman named
          Aobh, with whom he had four beloved children: Fionnuala, the eldest
          daughter, and her three younger brothers, Aodh, and the twins Fiachra
          and Conn. The family was the light of Lir’s life, living in happiness
          and harmony.<br />
          Tragically, Aobh passed away after the birth of the twins, leaving Lir
          heartbroken. To provide care and stability for the children, Lir
          married Aobh’s sister, Aoife. At first, Aoife appeared to be a loving
          stepmother, but as time went on, her heart was consumed by jealousy.
          She envied the children for the love and devotion Lir lavished upon
          them and resented the strong bond they shared as a family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to tolerate her jealousy, Aoife plotted a dark and cruel act to
          rid herself of the children. One day, while traveling with them, she
          led them to a remote lake. Using her powers as one of the Tuatha Dé
          Danann, she cast a spell on the children, transforming them into four
          beautiful white swans. Despite her cruelty, Aoife’s magic was not
          without limits. The children would retain their human voices and
          intellect, allowing them to speak and sing. However, the curse bound
          them to spend 900 years as swans: 300 years on Lough Derravaragh, 300
          years on the Sea of Moyle, and 300 years on the waters of Inis
          Gluaire. Only when they heard the ringing of a Christian church bell
          would the curse finally be broken. Realizing what she had done, Aoife
          fled, and the children were left to their fate.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first 300 years, the swan-children lived on the tranquil
          waters of Lough Derravaragh. Although their swan forms were beautiful
          and their voices enchanting, they were haunted by the loss of their
          human lives and their father, Lir.<br />
          When they moved to the Sea of Moyle, the next phase of their curse was
          far more challenging. The icy waters and fierce storms brought
          hardship and sorrow, yet the siblings stayed together, supporting one
          another with their bond of love and song.<br />
          The final 300 years were spent on the waters of Inis Gluaire, an
          isolated and desolate place. By now, the world had changed, and the
          Tuatha Dé Danann, once gods, had faded into myth. The swan-children
          grew lonely as memories of their father and their former lives became
          distant.
        </p>
        <p>
          At long last, the 900 years came to an end. By this time, Christianity
          had arrived in Ireland, and the children heard the tolling of church
          bells for the first time. They followed the sound to a nearby
          monastery, where a kind monk named Saint Mochaomhóg welcomed them. As
          the curse lifted, the children regained their human forms—but they
          were no longer the youthful children of Lir. The centuries had caught
          up with them, and they became frail, aged beings. Their time in the
          mortal world was brief, but they were finally able to be baptized as
          Christians before peacefully passing away. Saint Mochaomhóg buried
          them together, their souls free at last to reunite with their father
          and mother in the afterlife.

        <h2>An Bradán Feasa</h2>
        <p>
          Long ago, it was foretold that a great salmon swimming in the River
          Boyne would gain all the knowledge of the world by eating the
          hazelnuts that fell into the water from nine sacred hazel trees. These
          hazelnuts were said to contain the wisdom of the universe, and the
          salmon who consumed them became known as An Bradán Feasa, or the
          Salmon of Knowledge. <br />
          It was said that whoever first ate a piece of this salmon would gain
          all its wisdom and insight, becoming the wisest person in the world.
          Many sought this prize, but the salmon remained elusive.
        </p>
        <p>
          A great poet and sage named Finegas dedicated years of his life to
          finding and catching the Salmon of Knowledge. He finally succeeded
          after seven long years of searching along the banks of the River
          Boyne. Thrilled with his success, Finegas planned to cook and eat the
          salmon to claim its wisdom for himself. At that time, a young boy
          named Fionn mac Cumhaill (later to become the great leader of the
          Fianna) was living under Finegas’ tutelage, learning the ways of
          poetry, storytelling, and the ancient wisdom of Ireland. Finegas
          tasked Fionn with cooking the salmon, warning him not to taste even
          the smallest morsel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fionn obediently cooked the salmon over a fire, carefully tending to
          it so it would not burn. As he worked, a drop of hot fish oil from the
          salmon splashed onto his thumb, burning him. Instinctively, Fionn put
          his thumb into his mouth to soothe the pain.<br />
          In that moment, all the wisdom of the Salmon of Knowledge flowed into
          Fionn. When he brought the cooked fish to Finn Eces, the poet
          immediately noticed a change in the boy—there was a newfound light of
          understanding in his eyes. <br />
          Finn Eces asked Fionn if he had eaten any of the salmon. The boy
          explained what had happened, and the poet realized that the prophecy
          had been fulfilled. He accepted that the wisdom of the salmon was
          destined for Fionn, not himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that day forward, Fionn possessed extraordinary wisdom and
          insight. Whenever he sought guidance or knowledge, he would place his
          thumb in his mouth, recalling the moment he tasted the Salmon of
          Knowledge. This gift helped him grow into a great leader, allowing him
          to become the renowned warrior-poet and the wise leader of the Fianna,
          a band of heroic warriors who protected Ireland.
