                spent the entire summer in the city. <br>
                When the shooting began, he was surprised — <br>
                started watching the news, then stopped. <br>
                He walks around the city with headphones on, <br>
                listening to golden oldies, <br>
                as he stumbles into burned-out cars, <br>

                will be the words and music of a few geniuses <br>
                who desperately tried to warn us, <br>
                tried to explain, but failed to explain anything <br>
                or save anyone; <br>
                these geniuses lie in cemeteries <br>
                and out of their ribcages <br>
                grow flowers and grass. <br>
                Nothing else will remain — <br>
                only their music and songs, a voice <br>
                that forces you to love. <br>
                <br>
                You can choose to never turn off this music. <br>
                Listen to the cosmos, shut your eyes. <br>
                Think about whales in the ocean at night. <br>
                Hear nothing else. <br>
                See nothing else. <br>
                Feel nothing else. <br>
                Except, of course, for the smell, <br>
                the smell of corpses.” <br>

                Time-honored crafts reflect the ingenuity and soul of the Ukrainian people. Among these, embroidered towels known as rushnyky hold a special and symbolic place in Ukrainian culture.
                <br>
                Adorned with intricate patterns and motifs, rushnyky are more than decorative textiles—they are carriers of cultural heritage and spiritual beliefs.

            <p class="plain-text">
                These towels are traditionally gifted during significant life events, most notably at weddings. During the wedding ceremony, a rushnyk is often used to bind the hands of the bride and groom, symbolizing their union and the beginning of a shared journey. The patterns embroidered on the rushnyk—such as symbols of fertility, longevity, and prosperity—are meant to bestow blessings upon the couple. It’s also customary for parents to present rushnyky to their children as they embark on new stages of life, serving as tokens of love and protection.
                <br> <br>
                Beyond weddings, rushnyky play a role in various rituals and are commonly displayed in homes, hung over icons or pictures to invoke divine protection and to honor ancestors. Each region in Ukraine has its own distinctive embroidery styles and patterns, making rushnyky a rich tapestry of local traditions and artistry.
                <br> <br>
                Other traditional crafts include pottery, weaving, wickerwork, and the art of decorating Easter eggs known as pysanky are practiced across generations. Each craft is practiced across generations, with each region adding its own unique flair, showcasing a deep respect for tradition and cultural heritage.

Celebrations like Christmas, Easter, Kupala Night, St. Andrew’s Evening, and St. Mykola’s Day feature unique customs and traditional attire. Ritual songs such as carols (kolyadky), shchedrivky, and spring songs (vesnianky) accompany these festivities, preserving ancient rhythms and stories.

                Christmas in Ukraine is celebrated on December 24th. It is one of the most significant and beloved holidays, rich with traditions passed down through generations. Festivities begin on Christmas Eve, known as Sviat Vechir, with a family gathering for a solemn supper consisting of twelve meatless dishes, symbolizing the twelve apostles. Traditional foods like kutia (a sweet grain pudding), varenyky, and borsch are served.

            <p class="plain-text">
                Easter is a deeply spiritual and joyous holiday in Ukraine, marking the resurrection of Christ. Celebrated with great enthusiasm, it blends religious rituals with folk customs. One of the most iconic traditions is the creation of pysanky—intricately decorated Easter eggs made using a wax-resist method. Families attend midnight church services, and upon returning home, they break their fast with a festive meal that includes paska (Easter bread), meats, cheeses, and other delicacies. The greeting “Христос Воскрес!” (“Christ is Risen!”) is met with the response “Воістину Воскрес!” (“Indeed He is Risen!”), echoing throughout the celebrations.

            <p class="plain-text">
                Kupala Night, celebrated on the night of July 6th to 7th, is an ancient pagan festival marking the summer solstice and the height of the sun’s power. Rooted in fertility rites and nature worship, it is one of Ukraine’s most enchanting holidays. Traditions include lighting bonfires by rivers and lakes, with young people jumping over the flames to purify themselves and ensure good fortune. Girls weave flower wreaths and set them afloat on the water, hoping to foresee their future in love based on how the wreaths drift. The search for the mythical fern flower, said to bloom only on this night, symbolizes the quest for happiness and knowledge.

Celebrations may include attending church services, family gatherings, and sharing stories about the miracles and good deeds associated with St. Nicholas.

                Myths and legends are the soul of Ukrainian storytelling. Enchanting characters like forest spirits (lisovyk), water nymphs (mavka), and household guardians (domovyk) inhabit tales passed down through generations. These stories not only entertain but also impart moral lessons and preserve cultural values. Folk tales and legends continue to inspire literature, art, and cinema, keeping the mystical aspect of Ukrainian culture alive. As you can see above, Mavka is the main character of the film with the highest box office receipts in recent times. Although, she is definitely kinder than in myths and legends. And, in animation she has back.

                    Ukraine is probably the best place for IT specialists to grow.
                    <br>The low cost of living, cheap rents, and the ability to work online make it possible to save more and afford more.
                    <br>Many talented specialists and projects, such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R., have grown up on this fertile soil.
                    <br> <br>
                    S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is a game that millions of players around the world are looking forward to, and it has become a real event for Ukrainians. For us, this is not just a continuation of the cult series, but an opportunity to natively represent Ukrainian culture, history and atmosphere on a global scale. It includes more than 300 tracks by Ukrainian young artists. There is a playlist on Spotify that has collected all these tracks.
                    <br>The game reflects the unique landscapes of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, elements of our folklore and modern realities. Through S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, the world will be able to get to know Ukraine, its wealth and beauty better, which will help popularize our culture and strengthen Ukraine's position in the international IT arena.

                    Microsoft allocated money to make a movie about how gaming companies work during the war. The game was delayed because of the working conditions during the war and the fact that some team members went to defend the country. Unfortunately, some of them will not return to programming.
                    <br> <br>
                    That's why playing STALKER is not only a great triple-A game, but also a way to get to know our culture, learn about what the USSR left behind, and support Ukraine financially.

            <p class="label">History of the Ukrainian Language</p>
            <p class="plain-text">
                The Ukrainian language is a cornerstone of national identity and pride. <br>
                It has a rich and intricate history that mirrors the nation’s cultural and political journey.
                <br> <br>
                It was born from Old East Slavic in Kyivan Rus’ between the 9th and 13th centuries, evolved separately after Mongol invasions. During the 16th and 17th centuries, it flourished in literature, religious texts, and official documents within the Cossack Hetmanate. However, suppression followed the partitions of Poland and the incorporation of Ukrainian territories into the Russian Empire in the late 18th century.
                <br> <br>
                The Russian Empire restricted Ukrainian use through policies like the Valuev Circular of 1863 and the Ems Ukaz of 1876, aiming to assimilate Ukrainians and diminish their national identity. Despite these restrictions, the Ukrainian national revival emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, led by intellectuals, writers, and poets like Taras Shevchenko.
                <br> <br>
                Ukraine, after World War I and the collapse of empires, sought independence and language development. During the Soviet era, the language faced promotion and repression, with policies fluctuating between supporting Ukrainian education and media and enforcing Russification.
                <br> <br>
                After Ukraine’s independence in 1991, Ukrainian became the sole official state language. Efforts continue to promote its use in education, government, media, and public life. Ukrainian symbolizes national identity and resilience, reflecting Ukraine’s commitment to preserving cultural heritage and linguistic traditions.
                <br> <br>
                Today, millions speak Ukrainian, and it thrives despite past challenges. It stands as a testament to the Ukrainian people’s spirit and dedication to their unique identity. Its development over centuries reflects the nation’s resilience.

            <p class="label">Traditions of Hospitality and Everyday Life</p>
            <p class="plain-text">
                Hospitality is a cherished Ukrainian value, deeply ingrained in everyday life. Customs associated with guests emphasize warmth and generosity, often involving the sharing of food and stories. Unique communal practices like toloka, where neighbors gather to help each other with significant tasks, reflect a strong sense of community and mutual support. Evening gatherings, or vespers, foster close-knit relationships, highlighting the importance of family and friendship.
                <br> <br>
                They say that common grief unites people. The same thing happened in the winter of 2022. Millions of Ukrainians united as never before, despite yesterday's disputes. They organized charitable foundations, wove nets for the military, made trench candles, and helped the troops as much as they could. We continue to do this now and will continue until we win.

                It is hard to describe all culture in just one page. All you have seen here is just small part of culture of the country, which has more than 1000 years of history. If you are interested in something specific, be careful while Googling because russians loves to steal everything including culture. You can also find my contact on the main page, I would be happy to tell you more!
