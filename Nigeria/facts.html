                One of the most famous Christmas melodies worldwide, known as “Carol of the Bells,” originates from a Ukrainian folk song called “Shchedryk.” Composed by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych in 1916, the song is based on an ancient folk chant celebrating the arrival of spring and the bountiful new year. Its mesmerizing melody has been adapted and performed globally, becoming a staple in holiday music, yet its Ukrainian roots are often overlooked.

                    Ukraine has a storied history in aerospace engineering, particularly through the Yuzhne Design Bureau and Yuzhmash production plant in the city of Dnipro. Ukrainian engineers played a crucial role in developing rocket engines and intercontinental ballistic missiles during the Soviet era. The R-36M2 “Voevoda” missile, known by its NATO designation as “SS-18 Satan,” was designed and built in Ukraine. Today, Ukrainian expertise continues to contribute to international space exploration and satellite technology, including the development of launch vehicles like the Zenit rocket.

                Born in Kyiv in 1889, Igor Sikorsky was a pioneering aviation engineer who immigrated to the United States in 1919. He founded the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and designed the VS-300, America’s first practical helicopter, in 1939. Sikorsky’s innovations laid the foundation for modern helicopter design, transforming aviation and impacting fields from medicine to military operations. His work has left an indelible mark on global aviation history.

While attempting to distill alcohol for medicinal purposes, they discovered a method to refine kerosene from petroleum. This breakthrough led to the invention of the gas lamp, revolutionizing indoor and street lighting by replacing candles and oil lamps, and paving the way for modern petroleum-based lighting and heating.

                    In 1710, Ukrainian Hetman Pylyp Orlyk authored a constitution known as the “Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk,” considered one of the world’s first democratic constitutions. It outlined the separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches and emphasized the protection of human rights and liberties. Though it was not implemented due to political circumstances, it represents a significant historical document in the development of constitutional governance and democratic ideals.

                    If you google “The first constitution in Europe” you will get Wikipedia page that says that “The world's first written constitution was drafted in the United States of America in 1787.” That is not true and now you know why.

            <p class="plain-text">
                Arsenalna metro station in Kyiv is the deepest in the world, located 105.5 meters (346 feet) below ground. Well, China tries to build something even deeper, but the process hasn’t finished yet. Opened in 1960 as part of the first line of the Kyiv Metro, its depth was necessitated by the city’s hilly terrain and the proximity to the Dnipro River’s high banks. The station is an engineering marvel, with escalators that take several (4) minutes to ascend or descend, and it exemplifies Soviet-era architectural ambition. If you have a question why would we need the station that deep underground, the answer is pretty clear: it was build during the Cold War to act like nuclear shelter. The Cold War finished, but the station does act like a shelter during air alerts, not from American but russian missiles.

                At the forefront of Ukraine’s digital revolution is Diia, a groundbreaking mobile application and web portal launched by the Ministry of Digital Transformation in 2020.

Citizens can perform tasks such as opening a business, applying for social benefits, or renewing documents without visiting physical offices.
                <br> <br>
                Imagine having valid documents, processing documents for buying a house, opening a loan in one application from the comfort of your couch at home. We don’t have to.
